      <h1> Welcome to Fordham Final Exam Scheduler </h1>
      <p>
        Final exams can be stressful, but organizing your schedule doesn't have
        to be! We've created a simple and efficient tool for you to quickly
        create your final exam schedules and add them to their external
        calendars.
      </p>

      <h2> How It Works? </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Search Courses:</b> Find your courses using any parameter -
            course title, professor's last name, major, major tag and course
            number, or CRN.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Visualize Schedule:</b> Select your courses and your final exams
            will appear on a calendar with dates, times, and locations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Export Calendar:</b> Add to your Apple Calendar or save a
            screenshot of your final exam schedule.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2> Why Use This Tool? </h2>
      <p>
        Fordham publishes final exam schedules in an Excel sheet that requires
        you to manually search through, find your courses, and jot down the
        times and locations of your exams. This process can be time-consuming
        and frustrating, but our website makes it easy.

          Create Your Schedule!

      <h2> Made by Students, for Students </h2>
      <p>
        We understand how challenging finals week can be. That's why we built
        this tool to save you time and reduce stress. Hopefully, one day we can
        integrate this within Fordham's system so that your final exam schedules
        will be automatically created and sent to you.
